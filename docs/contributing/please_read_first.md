Contribution documentation is still in the process of being updated.

Right now the best place to discuss is just by raising a GitHub issue, if this project gets some traction then we may create a slack group or use GitHub discussions.

Coding practices and styling should be implemented within the next few months but if you are interesting in making a contribution then please get familiar with the architecture documentation.
