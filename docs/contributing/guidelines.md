# Contribution Guidelines

## Protocol Implementations

When contributing to low-level protocol implementations (e.g., DHCP, PPPoE, RADIUS), you must provide a list of all sources in your PR description.

!!! info "Required Sources"
    Include references to RFCs, IEEE standards, vendor specifications, or other authoritative documentation that informed your implementation.

## AI / LLM Usage

We don't prohibit the use of AI tools.

!!! tip "If you use AI"
    - PRs and documentation should reflect human effort and understanding
    - Review and understand AI-generated code before submitting
    - Include the specification/context file you used to prompt the AI in your PR description
    - For protocol implementations, you must still provide RFC/specification sources

This helps reviewers understand your approach and makes the contribution more valuable to the project.
